As part of this program[co] interns can expect to be important members of a focused and dedicated research institute and partake in ground breaking research. It is an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to exciting marine research[co] as well as experience the frustrations[co] the highs and the lows[co] and the achievements associated with ambitious and challenging marine research in Africa.\nOceans Research has established a strategic network of two research stations situated within the unique marine biomes of southern Africa[co] namely[co] Skeleton Coast Marine Lab and Mossel Bay Marine Lab. At each laboratory[co] researchers are conducting ambitious ecological[co] physiological and biological studies on resident marine top predators and their associated ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMossel Bay Marine Lab is the flagship and most established research laboratory within the Oceans Research network. It is also home to the institute[ap]s central office and management. The research laboratory is situated along the southern coast of Africa in a warm temperate marine biome that attracts numerous temperate water fish species. At the top of the food chain is the Cape fur seal that resides on Seal Island[co] the Great white shark that frequents the bay to hunt fur seals[co] numerous fish species and a semi resident population of bottlenose dolphins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested interns can also get involved with our educational program[co] where we educate mostly underprivileged schools regarding the importance of ocean conservation and the vital role sharks play in both the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\nSkeleton Coast Marine Lab is situated along the desert coast of Namibia at Walvis Bay[co] a worldwide mecca of dolphin watching and desert tourism. The Benguela current is the driving force behind one of the world[ap]s most abundant marine environments and attracts dense populations of marine mammals such as the Heaviside[ap]s dolphin[co] bottlenose dolphin[co] Cape fur seal and humpback whale. The Namibian coast line is considered one of the most undeveloped[co] beautiful places in the world.

If you are looking for the opportunity[co] training and experience to make a powerful and long-lasting impact on the policies that will shape our energy future[co] the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink[co] and the fate of the places we love[co] check out Environment America[ap]s Fellowship Program.\nRepowering America\nWe know we need to kick the nation[ap]s addiction to dirty energy. And we need to get started today. America has the know-how and the technology to generate 100% of our electricity from clean sources. We can cut our oil dependence dramatically within the next generation[co] and make our buildings[co] cars and appliances substantially more energy-efficient. And we can slash global warming pollution in the process. Read more at http://www.environmentamerica.org/new-energy-future.\nBut the oil and coal industries&mdash;as well as other powerful interests&mdash;are standing in the way of change. They have deep pockets and incredible influence over our decision-makers across the country and in Washington[co] D.C.[co] and they[ap]ll stop at little to maintain business as usual.\nThat[ap]s where Environment America comes in.\nWinning real changes in states across the country\nWith more than 100 professional staff and 1 million members[co] activists and allies in 29 states and Washington[co] D.C.[co] we make the case and mobilize the support necessary to overcome obstacles and win real results for the environment. We make changes at the state level and use them to build momentum for regional and national solutions to America[ap]s biggest environmental problems.\nEach year[co] Environment America hires passionate[co] talented and committed recent college graduates to join our two-year Fellowship Program. Over the last decade[co] candidates accepted into our Fellowship Program have worked side-by-side with our most experienced advocates and organizers to make a real difference for the environment.\nFor example[co] over the years dozens of fellows have helped persuade decision-makers in 14 states to increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. Building on those policies[co] President Obama announced similar changes across the nation. So now we[ap]re on track to have new cars get at least 40 miles per gallon and to put plug-in hybrids that get up to 150 miles per gallon on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about the changes we[ap]ve made across the country here:www.environmentamerica.org/results.\nBut it[ap]s going to take a lot more victories like this to end our addiction to oil[co] solve the climate crisis[co] and overcome our remaining environmental challenges. We need to keep documenting the problems and making the case for smart[co] effective solutions. We need to run more campaigns to inform the public and mobilize supporters to take action.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to build broader and stronger coalitions. We need to train and develop more organizers[co] advocates and other leaders to keep building the public support that can sweep past the opposition and create a cleaner[co] greener[co] healthier future.\nThat[ap]s where you come in.\nYou[ap]ll learn how to run winning campaigns for the environment\nIf you[ap]re hired[co] the Fellowship Program will give you the training you need and put you in the right place at the right time[co] so you can roll up your sleeves and make a difference right away.\nYou[ap]ll work with experienced advocates and organizers to make an immediate impact\nYou[ap]ll help plan[co] run and win campaigns. You[ap]ll learn how to research and identify effective solutions to critical environmental problems and how to build and mobilize powerful constituencies to get behind your campaign. You[ap]ll lobby lawmakers[co] publish opinion pieces in major newspapers and on key websites[co] set up and speak at news conferences[co] organize town hall meetings and rallies[co] and run citizen outreach campaigns to educate the public[co] build membership[co] and raise money for our work.

Learn more about our current fellows athttp://www.environmentamerica.org/jobs/watch-staff-profiles.\nYou[ap]ll participate in classroom-style trainings throughout the year[co] and learn even more through hands-on experience.

Learn more about the top advocates and organizers who supervise Environment America fellows athttp://www.environmentamerica.org/jobs/watch-staff-profiles.\nThe Fellowship is only the beginning\nThrough the Fellowship Program[co] you will develop relationships with lawmakers and community leaders[co] earn media coverage for important environmental issues[co] raise funds[co] build a membership[co] recruit and manage staff and volunteers[co] and run grassroots campaigns to promote clean energy[co] clean up our air and water[co] and preserve some of our nation[ap]s most beloved places. Bottom line: You[ap]ll make a real difference.\nAfter just two years[co] you[ap]ll have skills and experience that will set you apart from most recent college graduates[co] and you[ap]ll be prepared to take on even more leadership here at Environment America or elsewhere in the environmental community.\nQualifications\nWe are seeking recent college graduates who are ready to commit their time[co] skills and passion to grassroots political action on behalf of the environment.

This means that unlike Beijing and Shanghai there are very few foreigners around[co] if you are expecting to hang around solely with Europeans your options may be limited.\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition it also means there are very few bars and little night life. People hoping to go out drinking will be disappointed with the social options.\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side the city is well developed and clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some global supermarket chains showing food labels in English[co] and large department stores which make shopping easy. Living costs are around 1000-1500 RMB (100-150 EUR) per month.\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is only one English-language TV channel[co] the company has a DVD library with over 1000 DVDs for the staff to borrow.\nTo apply for this job[co] please email your CV to Excel@enfsolar.com\nPlease explain clearly why you wish to work in China.\nOur Chinese offices are located in Wuhu[co] Anhui province; please do not apply if you are not willing to work in this city.\n\n",
