The USDA Forest Service administers programs for applying sound conservation and utilization practices to natural resources of the national forests and national grasslands, for promoting these practices on all forest lands through cooperation with states and private landowners, and for carrying out extensive forest and range research to meet the needs of present and future generations. The Forest Service is also the largest forestry research organization in the world, and provides technical and financial assistance to state and private forestry agencies.\nNational Forests are America's great outdoors. They encompass 191 million acres of land, which is an area equivalent to the size of Texas. National forests provide opportunities for recreation in open spaces and natural environments. With more and more people living in urban areas, national forests are becoming more important and valuable to Americans. People enjoy a wide variety of activities on national forests, including backpacking in remote and unroaded wilderness areas, mastering an all-terrain vehicle over a challenging trail, enjoying the views along a scenic byway, or fishing on a great trout stream, to mention just a few.\nGifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest Service, summed up the purpose of the Forest Service &ndash; \"to provide the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people in the long run.\"\nThe Forest Service has a workforce of approximately 30,000 employees that reflects the full range of diversity of the American people. This includes cultural and disciplinary diversity, as well as diversity in skills and abilities.\nThe Forest Service motto, \"Caring for the Land and Serving People\" captures the spirit of our mission, which we accomplish through five main activities:\n1. Protection and management of natural resources on National Forest System lands.\n2. Research on all aspects of forestry, rangeland management, and forest resource utilization.\n3. Community assistance and cooperation with State and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners to help protect and manage non-Federal forest and associated range and watershed lands to improve conditions in rural areas.\n4. Achieving and supporting an effective workforce that reflects the full range of diversity of the American people.\n5. International assistance in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources.\nFor more information about the Forest Service, visit our website at http://www.fs.fed.us/ .\nDUTY LOCATION DESCRIPTION:\nThis position is located in New Ellenton, South Carolina at Savannah River.\nLocal Area Information\nUSFS-SR is located in the Central Savannah River Area, which includes the cities of Aiken, South Carolina (15 miles from USFS-SR) and Augusta, Georgia (30 miles from USFS-SR).

Living costs are around 1000-1500 RMB (100-150 EUR) per month.\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is only one English-language TV channel, the company has a DVD library with over 1000 DVDs for the staff to borrow.\nTo apply for this job, please email your CV to Excel@enfsolar.com\nPlease explain clearly why you wish to work in China.\nOur Chinese offices are located in Wuhu, Anhui province; please do not apply if you are not willing to work in this city.\n\n",

The projects demand significant scientific and practical responsibilities from participants, however, the demands are well within the capabilities of most students, and whilst being challenging, are enjoyable and exciting. As part of this program, interns can expect to be important members of a focused and dedicated research institute and partake in ground breaking research. It is an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to exciting marine research, as well as experience the frustrations, the highs and the lows, and the achievements associated with ambitious and challenging marine research in Africa.\nOceans Research has established a strategic network of two research stations situated within the unique marine biomes of southern Africa, namely, Skeleton Coast Marine Lab and Mossel Bay Marine Lab. At each laboratory, researchers are conducting ambitious ecological, physiological and biological studies on resident marine top predators and their associated ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMossel Bay Marine Lab is the flagship and most established research laboratory within the Oceans Research network. It is also home to the institute's central office and management. The research laboratory is situated along the southern coast of Africa in a warm temperate marine biome that attracts numerous temperate water fish species. At the top of the food chain is the Cape fur seal that resides on Seal Island, the Great white shark that frequents the bay to hunt fur seals, numerous fish species and a semi resident population of bottlenose dolphins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested interns can also get involved with our educational program, where we educate mostly underprivileged schools regarding the importance of ocean conservation and the vital role sharks play in both the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\nSkeleton Coast Marine Lab is situated along the desert coast of Namibia at Walvis Bay, a worldwide mecca of dolphin watching and desert tourism. The Benguela current is the driving force behind one of the world's most abundant marine environments and attracts dense populations of marine mammals such as the Heaviside's dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Cape fur seal and humpback whale. The Namibian coast line is considered one of the most undeveloped, beautiful places in the world. The Namib is the oldest desert in the world and is characterised by the conjunction of large fields of sand dunes meeting one of the world's richest marine environments, the cold currents of the Benguela ecosystem.\n\n",

        "description": "\n\nWork for a Cleaner, Greener, Healthier Future\nFrom the BP disaster in the Gulf to the climate crisis facing our planet, the need to confront big environmental challenges has never been clearer. If you are looking for the opportunity, training and experience to make a powerful and long-lasting impact on the policies that will shape our energy future, the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink, and the fate of the places we love, check out Environment America's Fellowship Program.\nRepowering America\nWe know we need to kick the nation's addiction to dirty energy. And we need to get started today. America has the know-how and the technology to generate 100% of our electricity from clean sources. We can cut our oil dependence dramatically within the next generation, and make our buildings, cars and appliances substantially more energy-efficient. And we can slash global warming pollution in the process. Read more at http://www.environmentamerica.org/new-energy-future.\nBut the oil and coal industries&mdash;as well as other powerful interests&mdash;are standing in the way of change. They have deep pockets and incredible influence over our decision-makers across the country and in Washington, D.C., and they'll stop at little to maintain business as usual.\nThat's where Environment America comes in.\nWinning real changes in states across the country\nWith more than 100 professional staff and 1 million members, activists and allies in 29 states and Washington, D.C., we make the case and mobilize the support necessary to overcome obstacles and win real results for the environment. We make changes at the state level and use them to build momentum for regional and national solutions to America's biggest environmental problems.\nEach year, Environment America hires passionate, talented and committed recent college graduates to join our two-year Fellowship Program. Over the last decade, candidates accepted into our Fellowship Program have worked side-by-side with our most experienced advocates and organizers to make a real difference for the environment.\nFor example, over the years dozens of fellows have helped persuade decision-makers in 14 states to increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. Building on those policies, President Obama announced similar changes across the nation. So now we're on track to have new cars get at least 40 miles per gallon and to put plug-in hybrids that get up to 150 miles per gallon on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about the changes we've made across the country here:www.environmentamerica.org/results.\nBut it's going to take a lot more victories like this to end our addiction to oil, solve the climate crisis, and overcome our remaining environmental challenges. We need to keep documenting the problems and making the case for smart, effective solutions. We need to run more campaigns to inform the public and mobilize supporters to take action.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to build broader and stronger coalitions. We need to train and develop more organizers, advocates and other leaders to keep building the public support that can sweep past the opposition and create a cleaner, greener, healthier future.\nThat's where you come in.\nYou'll learn how to run winning campaigns for the environment\nIf you're hired, the Fellowship Program will give you the training you need and put you in the right place at the right time, so you can roll up your sleeves and make a difference right away.\nYou'll work with experienced advocates and organizers to make an immediate impact\nYou'll help plan, run and win campaigns. You'll learn how to research and identify effective solutions to critical environmental problems and how to build and mobilize powerful constituencies to get behind your campaign. You'll lobby lawmakers, publish opinion pieces in major newspapers and on key websites, set up and speak at news conferences, organize town hall meetings and rallies, and run citizen outreach campaigns to educate the public, build membership, and raise money for our work. You'll even learn to recruit future Fellows to join Environment America staff.\nIn your second year, you'll polish your skills and take on even more responsibility. Learn more about our current fellows athttp://www.environmentamerica.org/jobs/watch-staff-profiles.\nYou'll participate in classroom-style trainings throughout the year, and learn even more through hands-on experience. You'll work alongside our current staff &mdash; some of the nation's top environmental advocates and organizers &mdash; and get guidance and feedback from your staff director. Learn more about the top advocates and organizers who supervise Environment America fellows athttp://www.environmentamerica.org/jobs/watch-staff-profiles.\nThe Fellowship is only the beginning\nThrough the Fellowship Program, you will develop relationships with lawmakers and community leaders, earn media coverage for important environmental issues, raise funds, build a membership, recruit and manage staff and volunteers, and run grassroots campaigns to promote clean energy, clean up our air and water, and preserve some of our nation's most beloved places. Bottom line: You'll make a real difference.\nAfter just two years, you'll have skills and experience that will set you apart from most recent college graduates, and you'll be prepared to take on even more leadership here at Environment America or elsewhere in the environmental community.\nQualifications\nWe are seeking recent college graduates who are ready to commit their time, skills and passion to grassroots political action on behalf of the environment. We look for smarts, academic excellence, creativity, top-notch written and verbal skills, and an eagerness to learn. We value leadership experience with campus and activist groups.\nPlacement\nFellowship candidates are hired nationwide and placed in Environment America offices across the country. During the interview process, you can express your interest in one location, some locations, or all of our locations. In making placement decisions, we will consider how best to match your location preference, experience, strengths and abilities with the campaigns we're running and the experienced staff in a particular office, city or state.\nSalary and benefits\nAs a recent graduate, you earn $23,750 in your first year and $24,250 in your second year as a Fellow. You're eligible to opt into our group health plan. You accrue two weeks of paid vacation over the course of your first year, and an additional three weeks in your second year. You're eligible to apply for college loan assistance after your third month, and to participate in our 401 (k) plan at the end of your first year. Salary and benefits vary in California and New York.\nHow to learn more or apply\nYou can apply online at https://www.environmentamerica.org/jobs/environmental-fellowship/fellowship-application.

The USDA Forest Service administers programs for applying sound conservation and utilization practices to natural resources of the national forests and national grasslands, for promoting these practices on all forest lands through cooperation with states and private landowners, and for carrying out extensive forest and range research to meet the needs of present and future generations. The Forest Service is also the largest forestry research organization in the world, and provides technical and financial assistance to state and private forestry agencies.\nNational Forests are America's great outdoors. They encompass 191 million acres of land, which is an area equivalent to the size of Texas. National forests provide opportunities for recreation in open spaces and natural environments. With more and more people living in urban areas, national forests are becoming more important and valuable to Americans. People enjoy a wide variety of activities on national forests, including backpacking in remote and unroaded wilderness areas, mastering an all-terrain vehicle over a challenging trail, enjoying the views along a scenic byway, or fishing on a great trout stream, to mention just a few.\nGifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest Service, summed up the purpose of the Forest Service &ndash; \"to provide the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people in the long run.\"\nThe Forest Service has a workforce of approximately 30,000 employees that reflects the full range of diversity of the American people. This includes cultural and disciplinary diversity, as well as diversity in skills and abilities.\nThe Forest Service motto, \"Caring for the Land and Serving People\" captures the spirit of our mission, which we accomplish through five main activities:\n1. Protection and management of natural resources on National Forest System lands.\n2. Research on all aspects of forestry, rangeland management, and forest resource utilization.\n3. Community assistance and cooperation with State and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners to help protect and manage non-Federal forest and associated range and watershed lands to improve conditions in rural areas.\n4. Achieving and supporting an effective workforce that reflects the full range of diversity of the American people.\n5. International assistance in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources.\nFor more information about the Forest Service, visit our website at http://www.fs.fed.us/ .\nDUTY LOCATION DESCRIPTION:\nThis position is located in New Ellenton, South Carolina at Savannah River.\nLocal Area Information\nUSFS-SR is located in the Central Savannah River Area, which includes the cities of Aiken, South Carolina (15 miles from USFS-SR) and Augusta, Georgia (30 miles from USFS-SR).
